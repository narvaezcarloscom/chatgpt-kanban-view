# ChatGPT Kanban View Proposal ðŸš€

## Context / Problem
As a daily user of ChatGPT for managing multiple projects, Iâ€™ve experienced a friction point:
- In long conversations, all content is stacked in a single vertical flow.
- Revisiting specific topics or deliverables requires endless scrolling.
- This limits productivity when working on complex projects with multiple phases.

## Proposed Solution
Introduce an **optional Kanban board view** within ChatGPT:
- Convert conversations or selected excerpts into *cards*.
- Organize cards into user-defined columns (e.g., *Ideas â†’ In progress â†’ Review â†’ Done*).
- Allow drag-and-drop between columns.
- Include optional auto-generated summaries.
- Enable switching between the current **chat view** and the new **Kanban view**.

## Benefits
- Organize and structure projects without leaving ChatGPT.
- Save time by avoiding manual scrolling/searching in chat history.
- Combine conversational creativity with structured project management.
- Expand ChatGPT into a true productivity hub.

## Why GitHub?
This repository documents the idea as a **serious UX proposal**, allowing:
- **Technical credibility:** Treated as a structured project, not just a thought.
- **Public portfolio:** Demonstrates product thinking and UX design in practice.
- **Evolution:** Future iterations, mockups, and feedback can be added here.
- **Community support:** Others can open issues, share insights, or propose enhancements.
